## Abstract
>With peer-to-peer gaming platform, people do not need to depend on centralized entities to play games or to receive game rewards. On top of this, the game result that could be verified by anyone and accessible to everyone would bring true "fair play". Utilizing the high throughput and negligible transaction cost of Zilliqa blockchain, we propose a solution to bring decentralization into gaming platform. Anyone can engaged to host a game by using the RedChillies token and anyone can participate to play the game using ZIL token (will be replaced by stablecoin in future). Results can be verified in smart contracts. And reward claims are distributed from stored Zil and REDC used in each game adding fresh RedChillies token from Reward Wallet. Rewards are distributed to hosts, winning players, developers and governors. As long as there remains majority of honest hosts, players and voters, system remains safe from attackers.
