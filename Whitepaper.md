RedChillies to Fuel the Gaming Platform on Zilliqa 

Last Updated: March 6, 2021

## Abstract
>With peer-to-peer gaming platform, people do not need to depend on centralized entities to play games or to receive rewards. On top of this, the game result that could be verified by anyone and accessible to everyone would bring true "fair play". Utilizing the high throughput and negligible transaction cost of Zilliqa blockchain, we propose a solution to bring decentralization into gaming platform. Anyone can engaged to host the game by using the RedChillies token and anyone can participate to play the game using Zil token. Results would be verified in smart contracts through voting system. And reward claims are distributed from storing Zil and REDC used in each game adding fresh RedChillies from Reward Wallet, which are distributed to hosts, winning players, developers and governors. As long as there remains majority of honest hosts, players and voters, system remains safe from attackers. 

## Introduction
Blockchain Technology is more than just a technology; it represents our ultimate fight for freedom; a path towards complete accessibility, security and ownership that can't be tampered. This is more like a freedom song written in code. And the path of Blockchain Technology towards mass adoption is inevitable. In this early stage of Web 3.0, there is much more need of bringing applications which are easy, yet fun, for people. The best way to teach people about blockchain technology is by making Dapps (Decentralized Applications) that people interact with. Gaming is one of the largest online sector for user engagement and revenue circulation. Gaming dapps will not only educate people about blockchain technology, it can be equally rewarding and connecting more people with complete ownership of their data, access and earnings. Taking this vision, we propose RedChillies on Zilliqa blockchain to fuel the gaming industry and bring user engagement into blockchain ecosystem.

The gaming platform that we intend to bring will utilize ZRC-2 complaint REDC token and native Zil token. REDC token will act as gas fee to host new games where players can bet Zil tokens to get rewards. Utilizing REDC tokens as host fee as well as reward, RedChillies would enable and sustain more game developers, hosts and players to grow in the ecosystem.

## The Curious Case of Zilliqa Selection
Online gamers always care the most about 4 things: "no fees", "speed", "win reward" and "fair play". Our gaming platform will always target to achieve these 4 goals. And the decision to build RedChillies on Zilliqa blockchain comes through this same mindset. Zilliqa blockchain utilizes Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) consensus mechanism and sharding techniques for high throughput and low transaction cost enabling highly scalable projects.

Along with high speed and low transaction cost, Zilliqa provides top-notch ecosystem for millions of users across Dapp, DeFi, Exchange, Finance & Marketplace. RedChillies has its roadmap aligned to collaborate with Zilliqa core team & Zillacracy and utilize all networks and partnerships for mass adoption.

## RedChillies as a Gaming Platform
RedChillies has defined four types of users in its platform: Game Developer, Game Host, Game Player and Game Governor. 

<b>Game Developer:</b> RedChillies will provide efficient tools for game developers to integrate web-based games with Zilliqa blockchain in near future. Initial phase 0 will focus on game developments curated by core team to stabilize the system. There will be 5 games in Phase 0 as Bet Games, Ludo Dice, Poker, Racing and Shooter. RedChillies will open its gaming platform for game developers in Phase 1. There will be no impact in REDC tokenomics while transitioning from Phase 0 to Phase 1. For every game played, developer of that game receives 10% of prize pool amount in Phase 0 and 1; 8% of prize pool amount from Phase 2.

<b>Game Host:</b> Each game available in RedChillies platform needs to be hosted by user to make it available for players to join the game. Instances of games are thus created by users themselves to become the Game Host by paying 1 REDC token. Game Hosts are rewarded with 10% of prize pool in each hosted game in Phase 0 and 1; 8% of prize pool amount from Phase 2. For any hosted game which fails to start or receive players will suffer the loss of 1 REDC token.

<b>Game Player:</b> Anyone having Zil tokens can participate in any hosted game which is not yet started. Game players need to bet at least 50 Zil token via ZilPay wallet. Winners of each game are rewarded 80% of prize pool amount. For any game betted which fails to start, players will be refunded for betted Zil.

<b>Game Governor:</b> We want to make RedChillies - a community driven project by Phase 2. Holders of REDC tokens will have voting power from Phase 2. Each of the game results will need "verification" vote before rewards can be claimed. Voting power counteracts any attackers or events who/which dishonestly or unfortunately influence the game results. Anyone with more than 1000 REDC tokens will have voting power and those who participates are called Game Governor. Game governor of each game will receive 4% of prize pool amount.

## Tokenomics of RedChillies
RedChillies will operate in REDC token with circular tokenomics and max supply of 2 millions REDC tokens. REDC is a ZRC-2 compliant fungible token which will primarily act as a gas fee to host any games. Every hosted game will normally costs 1 to 10 REDC token and every game-result will only reward 2 REDC tokens. RedChillies are distributed from prize pool to max 4 parties (Game Developer, Game Host, Game Player and Game Governor); thus maintaining inflation rate and implementing fair distribution of token supply.

Initial minting of 2,000,000 REDC tokens are simply distributed for locking rewards, building ecosystem and providing liquidity in exchanges (dex/cex). 1,000,000 REDC tokens are locked for distributing 1 REDC per game played, 300,000 REDC tokens are reserved for team with vesting schedule of 24 months, 600,000 REDC tokens will be available in exchanges and 100,000 REDC tokens will be distributed in marketing campaign or bounty hunt. There will be no private sale or initial offerings of REDC tokens. When "Game Reward Locked" goes to zero, game hosting fee may get adjusted (this is expected to happen after Phase 2 only and this will be decided by Game Governors).

Phase 0 starts in November 2020 when users are able to participate in RedChillies games. With each hosted games, 1 to 10 RedChillies as host fees goes to Reward Wallet and with every game-result, 2 RedChillies are distributed from Reward Wallet.

| Phases   | Involved Parties                          | Token Supply (REDC)     | Percentage Own |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------- | :-----------:  |
| Minting  | Game Reward Locked                        | 1,000,000               |      50%       |
| Minting  | Exchanges                                 |   600,000               |      30%       |
| Minting  | Marketing                                 |   100,000               |       5%       |
| Minting  | Team Development                          |   300,000               |      15%       |
|          | Max Supply                                | 2,000,000               |     100%       |

<b>Bet Games:</b> 

Bet Games are "live real sport events" played by users betting Zil tokens. The launch of November 2020 will include English Premier League (EPL) and UEFA Champions League game events. There will be 3 sections in Bet Games: Games Available for Hosting, Games Ready for Betting and Latest Live Games.

* Games Available for Hosting: This section will display upcoming games of EPL or Champions League which will be played in next 60 days. The games are updated daily in this section. It features "Host Now" functionality; which when clicked allows user to host that game by paying 1 REDC token through ZilPay. Such hosted games are then moved to "Games Ready for Betting" section. If user wants to host another game before "first hosted game" ends, it will cost 10 REDC token for every games to host.

* Games Ready for Betting: This section will display all hosted games. It features "Bet Now" functionality which is only activated before 48 hours of real game start; which when clicked allows user to bet the game in Zil token. A minimum of 100 Zil is required for each bet transaction. There are 3 pools to bet for each game: Win, Draw and Loss. "Bet Now" remains disabled before 48 hours of game starts and also when game actually starts.

>Example: To bet on "Manchester United Vs Chelsea" game, WIN pool represents "Game Win By Manchester United"; DRAW pool represents "Game Drawn" and LOSS pool represents "Game loss by Manchester United"

* Latest Live Games: This section will display recent or live games happening in real time.

Prize Pool: Prize Pool is a sumation of 2 REDC tokens and Zil amounts of lost pool. When a winning player claims the reward, smart contract will distribute "initial bet amount" of that wallet plus prize pool amount based on percentage of bet in winning pool.

> If no one bets in a hosted game or if no one bets against a bet, rewards are distributed under same logic of 80% to Winning Pool's wallets, 10% to Game Host and 10% to Developer. If there is no Winning Pool to receive 80% of Prize Pool, funds will remain in REDC wallet & undistributed Zils will be used to distribute players from Leaderboard or buy back REDC tokens from the exchanges to refill Locked Reward Wallets.

Example: If Manchester United won the game "Manchester United Vs Chelsea" and had following bets:

| Game ID                         | Result                                | Bets                    | Total Players | Prize Pool
| ------------------------------  | ------------------------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------- | :-----------:    |
| Manchester United Vs Chelsea    | WIN pool won (Manchester United won)  | WIN pool: 1000 Zil      |   2           | 2 REDC + 600 Zil |
|                                 |                                       | DRAW pool: 500 Zil      |   1           |                  |
|                                 |                                       | LOSS pool: 100 Zil      |   1           |                  |

In this example, if 2 players of WIN pool had betted 600 Zil : 400 Zil, & "Claim Rewards" feature will give:

a) Player 1 who betted 600 Zil: Reward = 600 Zil + 60% of (80% of 600 Zil) = 888 Zil
b) Player 2 who betted 400 Zil: Reward = 400 Zil + 40% of (80% of 600 Zil) = 592 Zil
c) Game Host (Phase 0 & Phase 1) : Reward = 10% of 600 Zil = 60 Zil
d) Game Developer (Phase 0 & Phase 1) : Reward = 10% of 600 Zil = 60 Zil

REDC charged from hosting of each game is stored in Treasury Contract for a month. On 1st of every month, Leaderboard Wallet receives these (2 * number of games played last month) REDC from Treasury + Reward Wallet. 
From Leaderboard Wallet: </br>

a) Top 10 players are rewarded with these 60% REDC tokens based on ranking.</br>
b) Highest better from a single game gets 10% REDC tokens.</br>
c) Biggest winner from a single game gets 10% REDC tokens.</br>
d) Most games playing wallet receives 10% REDC tokens.</br>
e) Random player will also get 10% REDC tokens.</br>

<b>Future Games:</b>  Ludo Dice, Poker, Racing and Shooter

## Roadmap of RedChillies
RedChillies was initiated while brainstorming potential use cases of ZRC-2 tokens during a discussion in Telegram Group "Zilliqa Official Chat". When Zilswap.io dex launched on October 2020, we minted RedChillies (REDC Token) to provide liquidity on same day. It has been since well received by the zilliqa community. The mere idea changed into promising project when we heard from Zilliqa core team about their willingness to support us. Eventually we gathered 3 developers to release first version of RedChillies independently. We are motivated and driven by the passionate Zilliqa community. Our roadmap reflects the prosperity of our Zilliqa community.
