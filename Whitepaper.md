## Abstract
>With peer-to-peer gaming platform, people do not need to depend on centralized entities to play games or to receive game rewards. On top of this, the game result that could be verified by anyone and accessible to everyone would bring true "fair play". Utilizing the high throughput and negligible transaction cost of Zilliqa blockchain, we propose a solution to bring decentralization into gaming platform. Anyone can engaged to host a game by using the RedChillies token and anyone can participate to play the game using ZIL token (will be replaced by stablecoin in future). Results can be verified in smart contracts. And reward claims are distributed from stored Zil and REDC used in each game adding fresh RedChillies token from Reward Wallet. Rewards are distributed to hosts, winning players, developers and governors. As long as there remains majority of honest hosts, players and voters, system remains safe from attackers. 

## Introduction
Blockchain Technology is more than just a technology; it represents our ultimate fight for freedom; a path towards complete accessibility, security and ownership that can't be tampered. This is more like a freedom song written in code. And the path of Blockchain Technology towards mass adoption is inevitable. In this early stage of Web 3.0, there is much more need of bringing applications which are easy, yet fun, for people. The best way to teach people about blockchain technology is by making Dapps (Decentralized Applications) that people interact with. Gaming is one of the largest online sector for user engagement and revenue circulation. Gaming dapps will not only educate people about blockchain technology, it can be equally rewarding and connecting more people with complete ownership of their data, access and earnings. Taking this vision, we propose RedChillies token on Zilliqa blockchain to fuel the gaming industry and bring user engagement into blockchain ecosystem.

The gaming platform that we intend to bring will utilize ZRC-2 compliant REDC token and native ZIL token (or ZRC-2 stablecoin). REDC token will act as primary fuel to host (create) new games where players can use ZIL tokens for in-game activities. In future, a stablecoin of Zilliqa ecosystem will replace the ZIL token for playing games. 
Utilizing REDC tokens as host fee and ZIL (or stablecoin) as in-game play, REDC enables and sustains more game developers, hosts and players to grow within the Zilliqa ecosystem.

## The Curious Case of Zilliqa Selection
Online gamers always care the most about 4 things: "no fees", "speed", "win reward" and "fair play". Our gaming platform always targets to achieve these 4 goals. And the decision to build RedChillies on Zilliqa blockchain comes through this same mindset. Zilliqa blockchain utilizes Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) consensus mechanism and sharding techniques for high throughput and low transaction cost enabling highly scalable projects.

Along with high speed and low transaction cost, Zilliqa provides top-notch ecosystem for millions of users across Dapp, DeFi, Exchange, Finance & Marketplace. RedChillies has its roadmap aligned to collaborate with Zilliqa core team & Zillacracy and utilize all networks and partnerships for mass adoption.


## Tokenomics of RedChillies token
All native dApps of RedChillies Labs will operate in REDC token with max supply of 2 million. REDC is a ZRC-2 compliant fungible token which will primarily act as a gas fee to host any games. Every hosted game will cost REDC token. RedChillies tokens are also distributed from leaderboard pool to max 4 parties (Game Developer, Game Host, Game Player and Game Governor); thus maintaining inflation rate and implementing fair distribution of token supply.

Initial minting of 2,000,000 REDC tokens are simply distributed for locking rewards, building ecosystem and providing liquidity in exchanges (dex/cex). 1,000,000 REDC tokens are locked for distributing REDC per game played, 300,000 REDC tokens are reserved for team with vesting schedule of 24 months, 600,000 REDC tokens will be available in exchanges and 100,000 REDC tokens will be distributed in marketing campaign or bounty hunt. There will be no private sale or initial offerings of REDC tokens. When "Game Reward Locked" goes to zero, game hosting fee may get adjusted (this will be decided from voting by REDC holers).

Initial Phase started in December 2020 when users are able to participate in RedChillies games. With each hosted games, 0.1 to 10 RedChillies as host fees goes to Reward Wallet and with every game-result, 0.2 RedChillies token are distributed from Reward Wallet.

| Phases   | Involved Parties for Supply                        | Token Supply (REDC)     | Percentage Own | 
| -------- | ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------- | :-----------:  |
| Minting  | Game Reward Locked                        | 1,000,000               |      50%       |
| Minting  | Exchanges                                 |   600,000               |      30%       |
| Minting  | Marketing                                 |   100,000               |       5%       |
| Minting  | Team Development                          |   300,000               |      15%       |
|          | Max Supply                                | 2,000,000               |     100%       |

## ZilChill as a Gaming Platform
ZilChill is a decentralized gaming platform where REDC tokens are utilized for governance and hosting games. ZilChill provides gaming services under two categories: (a) Prediction Market Games (b) Real-time Multiplayer Games. 

This platform has defined four types of users: Game Developer, Game Host, Game Player and Game Governor. 

<b>Game Developer:</b> RedChillies provides grants and efficient tools for game developers to integrate games with Zilliqa blockchain in near future. Initial phase will focus on game developments curated by RedChillies Labs' core team to stabilize the ecosystem. There are at least 4 games in initial Phase:<br>
| Category -> | Prediction Market Games (PMG)             | Real-time Multiplayer Games (RMG)   | Third-party Games (TPG) |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | :--------------------:  |
| Q1 2021     | Peer-to-peer Sports Prediction (Football) |                    -                |            -            |
| Q2 2021     | Peer-to-peer Sports Prediction (Cricket)  |                    -                |            -            |
| Q3 2021     |                             TBA           |  Ludo Dice                          |            -            |
| Q4 2021     | Advanced Prediction Market (Customizable) |                    -                |            -            |
| Q1 2022     |                             TBA           |                    -                | Scheduled (RMG)         |

ZilChill will open its gaming platform for other game developers in Phase 1 scheduled on Q1 2022. There will be no impact in REDC tokenomics while transitioning from initial Phase to Phase 1. For every game played, oracle of that game receives 5% of prize pool amount.

<b>Game Host:</b> Each game available in ZilChill platform needs to be hosted by user to make it available for players to join the game. Instances of games are thus created by users themselves to become the Game Host by paying REDC token. Game Hosts are rewarded with 10% of prize pool in each hosted game. For any hosted game which fails receive players will suffer the loss of host fee.

<b>Game Player:</b> Anyone having ZIL tokens (will be replaced by ZRC-2 stablecoin in future) can participate in any hosted game which is not yet started or completed. Game players need at least 20 Zil token for playing which can be transacted via ZilPay wallet. Winners of each game are rewarded 80% of prize pool amount. For any game which fails to start, players will be able to claim the spend amount as refund.

<b>Game Governor:</b> We want to make all platforms/dApps of RedChillies - a community driven project. Holders of REDC tokens have voting power. Each of the game results need "verification" before rewards can be claimed. Voting power counteracts any attackers or events who/which dishonestly or unfortunately influence the game results. Anyone with more than 100 REDC tokens (decided by [voting](https://vote.zilliqa.com/#/redc/proposal/QmYjmUnWW2PDDst3ZzrgrjZpQUjAZcmZXMgnHcQ6Gs3PUn)) are called Game Governor and they receive 5% of prize pool amount from each game.

## Games of ZilChill
Initial Phase targets to develop 4 games by RedChillies Labs' team: Peer-to Peer Sports Prediction (Football), Peer-to Peer Sports Prediction (Cricket), Ludo Dice, and Advanced Prediction Market. "Peer-to=peer Sports Prediction (Football)" was launched in December 2020 supporting ZilPay wallets.

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/SxJ90xG/Screen-Shot-2021-07-24-at-2-35-51-AM.png" alt="Screen-Shot-2021-07-24-at-2-35-51-AM" border="0" />

<b>1. Peer-to-peer Sports Prediction: Football, Cricket, TBA</b> 

>Peer-to-peer Sports Prediction Games are "live real sport events" played by users using ZIL tokens (in future to be replaced by ZRC-2 stablecoin). The launch of December 2020 included English Premier League (EPL) and UEFA Champions League game events. There are 3 sections in these Games: Games Available for Hosting, Games Ready for Prediction and Live Games Happening/Completed Games.

* Games Available for Hosting: This section displays upcoming real event games which will be played in next 30 days. The games are updated daily in this section. It features "Host Now" functionality; which when clicked allows user to host that game by paying 0.1 to 1 REDC token through ZilPay or Zeeves. Such hosted games are then moved to "Games Ready for Prediction" section. If user wants to host another game before "first hosted game" ends, it will cost 1 REDC token for every other game to host.

* Games Ready for Prediction: This section displays all the hosted games. It features "Predict Now" functionality which is only activated before 48 hours of real game start; which when clicked allows user to predict the game using ZIL token. A minimum of 20 ZIL is required for each prediction transaction. There are 3 pools to predict for each game: Win, Draw and Loss. "Predict Now" remains disabled before 48 hours of game starts and also when the game actually starts.

>Example: To predict "Manchester United Vs Chelsea" game, WIN pool represents "Game Win By Manchester United"; DRAW pool represents "Game Drawn" and LOSS pool represents "Game loss by Manchester United"

* Live Games Happening/Completed Games: This section displays live games happening in real time or recently completed games.

Prize Pool: Prize Pool is a sumation of ZIL amounts of lost pool. When a winning player claims the reward, smart contract will distribute "initial amount" of that wallet plus prize pool amount based on percentage of bet in winning pool.</br></br>
![#f03c15](https://via.placeholder.com/15/f03c15/000000?text=+) `Host's Reward = 10% of ZIL from Lost Pools`</br>
![#c5f015](https://via.placeholder.com/15/c5f015/000000?text=+) `Winner's Reward = Prediction Amount + (80% of ZIL from Lost Pools) * (Prediction Amount/Total ZIL amount of Winning Pool)`

> If no one predicts in a hosted game or if no one predicts against another prediction, rewards are distributed under same logic of 80% to Winning Pool's wallets, 10% to Game Host, 5% to REDC Holders and 5% to Game Oracle. If there is no Winning Pool to receive 80% of Prize Pool, funds will remain in REDC wallet & undistributed ZIL will be used to grant developers or buy back REDC tokens from the exchanges to refill Locked Reward Wallets in future.

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/tJfsvB9/Logic-Red-C.png"/>

Example: If Manchester United won the game "Manchester United Vs Chelsea" and had following bets:

| Game ID                         | Result                                | Bets                    | Total Players | Prize Pool
| ------------------------------  | ------------------------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------- | :-------------:    |
| Manchester United Vs Chelsea    | WIN pool won (Manchester United won)  | WIN pool: 1000 Zil      |   2           | 0.2 REDC + 600 Zil |
|                                 |                                       | DRAW pool: 500 Zil      |   1           |                    |
|                                 |                                       | LOSS pool: 100 Zil      |   1           |                    |

In this example, if 2 players of WIN pool had predicted 600 Zil : 400 Zil, & "Claim Rewards" feature will give:

a) Player 1 who predicted 600 Zil: Reward = 600 Zil + 60% of (80% of 600 Zil) = 888 Zil</br>
b) Player 2 who predicted 400 Zil: Reward = 400 Zil + 40% of (80% of 600 Zil) = 592 Zil</br>
c) Game Host: Reward = 10% of 600 Zil = 60 Zil</br>
d) Game Oracle : Reward = 5% of 600 Zil = 30 Zil</br>
e) REDC Holder : Reward = 5% of 600 Zil = 30 Zil</br>

REDC charged from hosting of each game is stored in Treasury Contract for a month. On 1st of every month, Leaderboard Wallet receives these (2 * number of games played last month) REDC from Treasury + Reward Wallet. 
From Leaderboard Wallet: </br>

a) Top 10 players are rewarded with these 60% REDC tokens based on ranking.</br>
b) Highest better from a single game gets 10% REDC tokens.</br>
c) Biggest winner from a single game gets 10% REDC tokens.</br>
d) Most games playing wallet receives 10% REDC tokens.</br>
e) Random player will also get 10% REDC tokens.</br></br>

<b>2. Real-time Multiplayer Games: Ludo Dice</b> 

Ludo Dice is the first real-time multiplayer game published in ZilChill platform. It is "strategy board game without partnership" and played among 2 to 4 players. Each player is assigned 4 tokens with a goal to move those 4 tokens in "Home" zone by rolling a dice. </br>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/mTT2rRb/Screen-Shot-2021-07-13-at-11-32-38-AM.png" alt="Screen-Shot-2021-07-13-at-11-32-38-AM" border="0" />
</br>

There are also 3 sections in Ludo Dice platform: Hosting a Ludo Dice Game, Games Ready for Playing and Live Games Happening/Completed Games.

* Host a Ludo Dice Game: This section displays user selection for "Number of Players" and "Joining Fee". It features "Host Now" functionality; which when clicked allows user to host that game by paying 0.1 to 10 REDC token through ZilPay or Zeeves. Such hosted games are then moved to "Games Ready for Playing" section. Hosting costs varies based on selection of ""Number of Players" and "Joining Fee". Host must open the game by paying the joining fee. All open hosted games expire after 10 minutes if no other players join the game.

* Games Ready for Playing: This section displays all the hosted games. It features "Join Now" functionality which is only activated for 10 minutes after Host opens the game by joining himeself/herself; which when clicked allows user to join the game using ZIL token. A minimum of 20 ZIL is required for Ludo Dice game as joining fee depends on each game.

* Live Games Happening/Completed Games: This section displays live games happening in real time or recently completed games. Anyone can spectate the live game and participate in chat message to support the players.

Prize Pool: Prize Pool is a sumation of ZIL amounts of all players. When a winning player claims the reward, smart contract will distribute ZIL reward amount based on ranking of players.</br></br>
![#f03c15](https://via.placeholder.com/15/f03c15/000000?text=+) `Host's Reward = 10% of ZIL from Pools`</br>
![#c5f015](https://via.placeholder.com/15/c5f015/000000?text=+) `Winner's Reward = Based on ranking when game completes.`

## Roadmap of RedChillies
RedChillies was initiated while brainstorming potential use cases of ZRC-2 tokens during a discussion in Telegram Group "Zilliqa Official Chat". When Zilswap.io dex launched on October 2020, we minted RedChillies (REDC Token) to provide liquidity on same day. It has been since well received by the zilliqa community. The mere idea changed into promising project when we heard from Zilliqa core team about their willingness to support us. Eventually we teamed up 3 developers to release first version of RedChillies independently. We are motivated and driven by the passionate Zilliqa community. Our roadmap reflects the prosperity of our Zilliqa community.
